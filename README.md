## Installation
Ensure **Python 3** (Preferably 3.11.6 as this program has been only extensively tested on this version) is installed.

This program relies on quite a few of external libraries which are not automatically packaged with Python 3.11.6, which are the following but not limited to:
- Flask
- Dotenv
- werkzeug

For now, an automatic library installation process has not been yet implemented, but you can install each library by executing the following command into Command Prompt / Terminal.

`pip3 install LIBRARY_NAME_HERE`

## Usage
Open command prompt and execute the command: `python app.py` then open the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser
